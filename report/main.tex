\section{Testing Methodology}

For testing of the engine, we re-used our python script that generates random input files for the grader and we run it
continuously check for any test failures. The generate input files of different sizes, from 4 to 40
clients and up to 40000 orders. It is ran for $> 100$ iterations for large cases and $> 1000$
iterations for medium size cases to ensure the engine is likely to be correct.
The python script is in \texttt{scripts} directory. We
also ran our engine the go data race detector to check for data races.
